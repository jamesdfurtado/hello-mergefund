# Hello MergeFund! - James Furtado Submission

**Built for the MergeFund's "Hello MergeFund" challenge.**

*[MergeFund](https://mergefund.org) is a new website that incentivizes developers to make open source contributions by paying those who submit successful PRs to issues.*

For MergeFund's launch, they held a contest for users to submit their most creative "Hello World" program!

* My submission was a retro browser game where you shoot down letters to spell "Hello MergeFund". Winners get a firework display!

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. *All done!*

## üí° Creative Approach
- I chose to mimic the classic arcade shooter game, "Space Invaders".
    - I tried to preserve the "retro" feel as best as possible by using pixel graphics and synth sound effects.
- I wanted to emphasize the celebration of MergeFund's launch with an energetic win screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 Canvas for the game and fireworks
- Web Audio API for sound effects


## ‚úçÔ∏è Author's Note
Special thanks to all of those working to make MergeFund possible!
